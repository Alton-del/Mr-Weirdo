    Goku is often seen as better than Eren because of his selflessness, positivity, and constant growth. While Erenâ€™s journey is filled with moral conflict and darkness, Goku fights for the greater good, always protecting his loved ones and the world. His determination, kindness, and ability to inspire others make him a more universally admired and enduring hero.
