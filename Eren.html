    Eren is considered better than Goku due to his complexity and raw determination. While Goku embodies positivity and selflessness, Eren’s journey is marked by personal struggle and moral ambiguity. His willingness to make tough, even controversial decisions for his goals shows a darker, more relatable side of humanity. Eren’s evolution from a hopeful hero to a tragic figure reflects his growth and depth, making him a more intriguing and layered character.
